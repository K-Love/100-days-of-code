**Day 2: January 3, 2018**

**Today's Progress:** Installed jQuery, Bootstrap, Tether, and React Developer Tools. Also set up the API for the back end.

**Thoughts:** This was another day mostly about setup. The project also requires MongoDB, which I already had installed. Smooth sailing so far.

**Day 1: January 2, 2018**

**Today's Progress:** Got set up to create a swag shop in ReactJS with their pre-built skeleton project. I'm going off of a Sitepoint course on React. 

**Thoughts:** I've had ReactJS on my mind for a while now, but haven't jumped on it. It feels good to start a project and learn this framework since it's gaining so much popularity. The setup was pretty easy with create-react-app. I like the sound of how these components are going to work.
